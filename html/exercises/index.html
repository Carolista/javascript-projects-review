    <p>I have been thinking about creating a web application that will allow me to keep track of my knitting and crocheting projects. I could combine information like type of item, date completed, yarn used, needle/hook size(s) used, stitches used, etc. I would also add the capability of linking to documents like notes and patterns and uploading photos of the finished product.</p>
